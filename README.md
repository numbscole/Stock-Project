# Stock-Project
This was my semester project in my OOP-Java course, Fall 2017. The overall project consisted of three major milestones:

Project 1 - Given a text file containing stock information, create a virtual stock broker with a budget to predict if a stock is worth a buy. Design based on StockDataADT and PredictorADT instances. (Code in Project1/StockBroking/StockBroking)

Project 2 - Create a basic GUI interface using windowbuilder to interact with a broker. Our professor provided us with code based on Project 1 to create an even playing field for the class so the only class I wrote within this directory was the Project2/windowBuilder/windowBuilder/ProjectRunner.java class.

Project 3 - Finally, we implemented our project into a servlet. (New code found in Project3/project3/WebContent)
